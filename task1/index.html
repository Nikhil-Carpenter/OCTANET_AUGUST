        <h3>About Us</h3>
        <p>
          We are a group of people with decades of experience in growing and
          selling apples. We know what a good apple looks like and how they are
          grown. This essential fruit requires a temperate climate, loamy soil
          that is rich in organic matter apart from needing proper drainage and
          aeration facilities. Lucky for us we live in Kashmir which is proudly
          known as paradise of earth is also home to temperate fruits like apple
          for which the state is very famous across globe. The main factor which
          influence temperate fruit bearing trees is soil, climate and
          environment which are highly favorable and unparalleled in the
          province of Kashmir. Kashmiri apples a unique look, taste, flavor,
          size and color.
